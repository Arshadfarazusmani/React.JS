# Step 1: Install a build tool 
The first step is to install a build tool like vite, parcel, or rsbuild. These build tools provide features to package and run source code, provide a development server for local development and a build command to deploy your app to a production server.

# Vite 
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

```
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
```
